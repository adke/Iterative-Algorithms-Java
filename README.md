# Iterative Algorithms Java
#### Assignments within this repository deals with integer arrays where searching, merging, and sorting will take place using iterative methods in java.  

#### Searching: Program will implement a binary search for a sorted array (lowest value - greatest value) that will check to see whether or not the target element exists within that array. 

#### Merging: Program will merge two sorted integer arrays into a single third sorted integer array (lowest value - greatest value).

#### Sorting: Program will implement three classic sort algorithms including bubble sort, insertion sort, and selection sort. The relative efficiency will be compared for each sort using reads and writes aka "getters" and "setters". The program will sort large sets of data that is in random order. 

   - Bubble Sort: Straightforward and simplistic method of sorting data. The algorithm starts at the beginning of the data set. It compares the first two elements, and if the first is greater than the second, it swaps them. It continues doing this for each pair of adjacent elements to the end of the data set. It then starts again with the first two elements, repeating until no swaps have occurred on the last pass. Bubble sort average case and worst case are both O(n²). 
     
   - Insertion Sort: Simple sorting algorithm that is relatively efficient for small lists and mostly-sorted lists. It works by taking elements from the list one by one and inserting them in their correct position into a new sorted list. In arrays, the new list and the remaining elements can share the array's space, but insertion is expensive, requiring shifting all following elements over by one.  
   
   - Selection Sort: Selection sort is an in-place comparison sort. It has O(n²) complexity, making it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort. Though, it is known for its simplicity and can be advantageous over more complicated algorithms in certain situations. It takes the smallest element within a set range and shifts that value towards the left of the array.  

#### Note: There are java test files associated with each assignment to test the code. Please install JUnit for the tests to work on your IDE.
